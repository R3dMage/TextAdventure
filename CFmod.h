//
// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// This tutorial shows how to load and play MP3 and WAV files.  This is was
// an exciting tutorial to write because it does so much for you!  The Fmod library
// is perfect for games and demos.  Check out the DarkSide demo at our site to see
// it in action.  
// 
// * What Can I Play With This? * (WAV, MP3)
// 
// Though this tutorial only plays .mp3's, it will play a .wav with the same code,
// there is no need to change anything except the actual file name.  Cool huh?
//
// Once again, using mods for demos is cool because you can check the position in the
// song, then trigger a cool effect depending where it is.  For instance, you could
// say, if the order is 8 and the row is 36, Scale the screen, or start moving in.
// There is so much that can be done with the FMod Sound System, but I have no idea
// how to do it all.  Hopefully I can get a .MP3 tutorial up with it, or a .WMA.
//
// I love this library and I hope you will too!!  Let us know what you do with it.
//
// I would like to thank the team at www.Fmod.org for the library and also the sample
// source code.  The code in this tutorial was primarily from the sample distributed
// in the FMod library.
//
// I would also like to thank NIB at freemp3snib.homestead.com for the music!
